    <h5><p>My hobbies is what I enjoy doing most. Either just relaxing with my friends and my girlfriend, going to dinner
    with all of them and just enjoying the time I get with them. Playing frisbee, football, and basketball with them whenever I get the chance.
    Going to the gym together and getting a workout in is my favortie way to spend my time. Attending school events together and'
    having a blast. When i'm not surrounded by my friends i'm either tied up with work or school. I started working at Dick's Sporting
    Good's at the start of the school year and I love my job there, with everything I have to accomplish on a day to day bases I always
    make sure I leave time for friends and family.</p>

    <h5><p>Hey all, thank you for checking out my web page! On this page you will learn about me, Austin Frechette.
        I will tell you about my hobbies, my favorite things and a few other things along the way. First off I am in my first year of college
        and I decided to attend the University of Maine in Orono. I chose this school because I have been a Maine resident my whole life
        and wanted to stay in Maine. I enjoy playing multiple sports including football, basketball, and soccer. I have a love for cars old
        and new. I enjoy spending my time surrounded by my friends and girlfriend, unless I have work or class. </p>

    <h5><p>I've always had a passion for cars my entire life. When I got my first car that's where it all started.
    My 2000 528I BMW, it was a great first car, but I eventually ended up trading up the ranks to car I enjoyed more. I've had
    7 cars since then and I now drive a 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT, and it's easily my favorite car i've owned. I love everything
    about it, the color, the sound it gives off, and the antique part of it. Being 27 years old I always get looks as I drive by, or pull
    up to the gas station in it. I enjoy everything my car provides for me, but in all reality i'll most likely end up trading it
    by the end of this summer.</p>

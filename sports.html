    <h5><p>I have been involved with sports my whole life. I started playing sports when I was 5, I started when i was five
    and continued with that for a couple years until i was seven. As my passion for sports continued to grow I eventually moved
    onto football and that is my favorite sport to this day. I played football for fourteen years and once high school ended
    that was when my football career ended too. I played basketball for a couple years starting in Jr. high, but it never impacted
    me like football did. I still keep up with football and basketball, I watch the NFL and NBA every day possible and I never see that changing.
    I attend as many school sporting events, including frisbee, football, basketball, and soccer as I enjoy doing as much
    physical activity as possible.</p>
